`Not speaking Punjabi <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=354826>`__ actually made me `speak Chinese <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?oldid=244307&action=interdiff&newid=245009&headers=1>`__. Well, not really.

The lesson to take away is, you may not be able to speak a language, but looking at a patch on a mac with Chinese fonts sure does catch some bugs. Looking at the bugzilla diff pages in UTF-8 encoding is a good exercise when approving patches to unkown languages.
