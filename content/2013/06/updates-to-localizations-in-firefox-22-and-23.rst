If you haven't noticed already, we think our localizers are pretty awesome. We're proud to announce that, on top of all the teams that follow the rapid release process, today's update to Firefox desktop 22 (and Firefox 23 Beta) contains major updates to a few localizations that we'd like to call out.

We'd like to thank the teams for their rededicated efforts and commitment to provide the users of their regions with the best localized browser on earth. In order to demonstrate the potential impact their efforts have made, I have outlined the potential number of native speakers of each language based on the populations of the language's regions (see  `Ethnologue's research <http://www.ethnologue.com>`__):

-  Gujarati (gu-IN) = 46,633,190
-  Hindi (hi-IN) = 260,302,820
-  Kannada (kn) = 37,739,040
-  Malayalam (ml) = 33,534,600
-  Northern Sotho (nso) = 4,101,000
-  Oriya (or) = 50,137,290
-  Punjabi (pa-IN) = 29,518,600
-  `Songhay (son) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songhai_languages>`__ = 3,400,000
-  Tamil (ta, India) =  68,763,360
-  Telugu (te) = 74,049,000
-  Zulu (zu) = 10,349,100
-  Thai (th) = 20,421,280
-  Maithili (mai) = 32,800,000
-  South African English (en-ZA) = 50, 500,000
-  Hungarian (hu) = 12,319,330
-  Ukrainian (uk) = 36,028,490

Thank you very much and congratulations on your success!
