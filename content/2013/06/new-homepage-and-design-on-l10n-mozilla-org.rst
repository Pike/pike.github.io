Today we've launched a new homepage on `l10n.mozilla.org <https://l10n.mozilla.org/>`__, and a new sandstone theme.

The l10n site now integrates better with the rest of the mozilla websites, and the homepage is more engaging.

Special thanks go to `Matjaz Horvat <https://mozillians.org/u/mathjazz/>`__, it's his first big landing to elmo, the code behind l10n.m.o. The homepage redo was spearheaded by `Jeff Beatty <https://mozillians.org/u/gueroJeff/>`__, and the design was done by `Matt Ternoway <http://www.ternowaydesigns.com/>`__.
