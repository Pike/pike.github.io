If you're a localizer, please look at `my post in .l10n <http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.l10n/browse_thread/thread/ad8ffe746b6b90e4/ecbd7a6c9e722240#ecbd7a6c9e722240>`__ on what to do to sign off on your localization. As we've been doing quite a few QA and testing cycles so far, there should be very little work left to do but actually closing the bug. Nevertheless, the use of litmus to structure and report your testing efforts is quite inconsistent between teams. The current lead in localized test reports is Finnish with some 300 tests. That's not really the target count, but given that quite a few others haven't submitted reports, it shows the variation that we have in our community. If you haven't submitted test results yet, please try to go at least through the l10n tests.

If you're in the release team, the interesting bug queries are `resolved bugs <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&resolution=FIXED&bugidtype=include&bug_id=352122%2C350035%2C350048%2C352112%2C350039%2C350047%2C350043%2C350432%2C350060%2C350041%2C350036%2C352113%2C352126%2C350032%2C350164%2C350038%2C350050%2C352109%2C350054%2C352120%2C350045%2C352115%2C350461%2C350049%2C352123%2C350040%2C352119%2C350056%2C350057%2C350051%2C350042%2C350472%2C350160%2C352121%2C351390%2C350044%2C352114%2C352127&chfieldto=Now>`__ and `open bugs <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&resolution=---&bugidtype=include&bug_id=352122%2C350035%2C350048%2C352112%2C350039%2C350047%2C350043%2C350432%2C350060%2C350041%2C350036%2C352113%2C352126%2C350032%2C350164%2C350038%2C350050%2C352109%2C350054%2C352120%2C350045%2C352115%2C350461%2C350049%2C352123%2C350040%2C352119%2C350056%2C350057%2C350051%2C350042%2C350472%2C350160%2C352121%2C351390%2C350044%2C352114%2C352127&chfieldto=Now>`__ blocking the `Firefox 2 l10n release <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=fx20l10n>`__ tracking bug. 13 signed off and counting, 25 remaining.
