`FOSDEM 2009 <http://fosdem.org/2009/>`__ will be on February 7/8. Please block your schedules for that weekend, as it will be great as ever.

If you're in Europe, you know that you want to come. If you're not, you know that John suggested to try Europe out, and there's hardly a better chance to do so than FOSDEM.

"This" years program committee will be `Brian King <http://brian.kingsonline.net/talk>`__, `Paul Rouget <http://blog.mozbox.org/>`__ and me. If you're interested in presenting, please add yourself to the `session proposals on the wiki <https://wiki.mozilla.org/FOSDEM_2009/Session_Proposals>`__. We'll start this off as free-form as you're used to.

As always, we're going to keep you updated on things as we find them out, more details to come.
