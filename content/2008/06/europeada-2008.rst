Just wanted to point all of you into soccer and languages at the `EUROPEADA 2008 <http://www.europeada2008.net/>`__, that's currently on. *"The soccer tournament for the autochthonous, national minorities in Europe"*, as they say themselves. There's a video featuring some of the languages spoken on `tagesschau.de <http://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/sprachenem2.html>`__ (German).
