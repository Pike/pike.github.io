While reverse-engineering ``make-jars.pl`` for `bug 361583 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=361583>`__, I wondered why we did that weird locking in there.

Turned out that that was a fix I reviewed, for `a bug I filed, 55174 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=55174>`__. 5 digit bugnumer, dating back to 2000. Those were the days of

   make -j32 install

I bet picard got its plug pulled by now.
