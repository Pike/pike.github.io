To echo this on planet, too, the 1.9.1 l10n repositories are open for business.

Please read my `introductory post in mozilla.dev.l10n <http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.l10n/browse_frm/thread/a49e49518480c022#>`__ before making changes to both the l10n-central and the releases/l10n-mozilla-1.9.1 repositories.

If you have questions, please ask in #l10n or in the newsgroup.

I have triggered builds on all comm-central apps and Firefox 3.1 to pick up the new setup, so `the dashboard <http://l10n.mozilla.org/dashboard/>`__ is all good again. The tree names remain unchanged, i.e., fx31x is the Tree towards Firefox 3.1, now picking up changes on the releases/l10n-mozilla-1.9.1 repositories as well as releases/mozilla-1.9.1 for en-US changes.
