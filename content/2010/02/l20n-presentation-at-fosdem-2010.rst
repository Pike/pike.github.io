I'll be presenting at FOSDEM on l20n, the infrastructure that we're hoping to move our localization efforts to. The talk will be in the Mozilla Developers room on Sunday, 13:15. The FOSDEM program might still give a Sunday morning time, that changed.

I'll focus on what tools can do to help localizers to use the power that l20n brings, without making things totally obscure. I'll start with a quick recap for those that are new to it, and then discuss the challenges that l20n brings, and how tools can help. I'll also present first thoughts on how to communicate data describing languages between tools, using html5 and microdata.

See you in Brussels, not just for that talk, of course.

PS: I'll be giving a lightning talk on the new l10n site, too.
