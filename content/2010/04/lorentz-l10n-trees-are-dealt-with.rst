The project tree for Lorentz is winding down at various places, and the l10n dashboards make no difference.

The l10n builds off of the ``projects/firefox-lorentz`` project tree named "lorentz" have been stopped, and the sign-offs are closed.

Sign-offs for the ongoing work on 3.6.x including the lorentz strings should now go back onto the `fx3.6 app version <https://l10n-stage-sj.mozilla.org/shipping/dashboard?av=fx3.6>`__. Sign-offs from the lorentz tree have been migrated to fx3.6 where it made sense to me.
