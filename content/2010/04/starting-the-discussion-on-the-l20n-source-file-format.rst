I just kicked of the public discussion on the l20n source file format in the `localization 2.0 google group <http://groups.google.com/group/localization-20/t/c3508a59525f0eea>`__. This is supposed to be the first of a series of discussion guiding us to a specification and a plan on how to implement it.

Why a google group? We're hoping to gather feedback from within and outside the Mozilla community, and we're hoping that not branding the discussion group might help. Yeah, we're branding it google instead, we'll see if it works out.

We'd love you to jump in on the discussion, to criticize and experiment. Replies are not bound to any particular form, as are proposals. Put them where you think you can transport the message best and send a pointer to the group.

The spam settings on that group are currently "first post is moderated", and both Gandalf and I can flip the switch for you. So if you think that your message doesn't make it through, poke either of us.
