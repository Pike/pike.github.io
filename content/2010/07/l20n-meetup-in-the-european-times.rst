I heard there was interest to join the l20n discussions, so I'll do an "even more public" invitation to tomorrow's l20n call.

We're going to have that call on conference bridge 206 at 11 am CET, standard mozilla conference call details. Blame Seth for being almost-european these days, even if it's just timezone. (No, not calling London Europe, no way.)

The agenda for this call is to look at some l20n-compiled files for browser.xul to make an educated decision on how to encode both external vs internal properties, and multi-locale files.

Sorry for the late invite, if you're not on my radar and can't make the meeting at such European hours, please follow up here, or by mail, and leave a note of your timezone.
