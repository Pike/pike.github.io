I'll be presenting on `l20n <http://wiki.mozilla.org/L20n>`__ at `FOSDEM this weekend <http://fosdem.org/2007/schedule/events/mozilla_l20n>`__. The slides are mostly done, and to the extent that slides without the presenter are any useful in general, are `up for everyone to see <http://people.mozilla.com/~axel/talks/FOSDEM2007-l20n/>`__. Note, that link may not stay there.

I posted to several open-source i18n/l10n lists last night, and got some feedback triggering a new example, `declensions and special cases <http://people.mozilla.com/~axel/l20n/js-l20n/sample-05.html>`__.
