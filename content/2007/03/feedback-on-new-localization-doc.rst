I'd like to get some wider feedback on the `Create a new localization <http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Create_a_new_localization>`__ document on MDC. If you have comments, the talk page is probably the best place to put them.

I added a link to `L10n:Tools <http://wiki.mozilla.org/L10n:Tools>`__, so if you'd like to recommend a tool to work on localization for Mozilla apps, please head over there and make sure that it's both sexy and correct.
