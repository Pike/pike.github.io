I'll be spending some time at LinuxTag 2007, here in Berlin, Friday and Saturday. There seem to be a few interesting talks on the `program <http://www.linuxtag.org/2007/en/conf.html>`__, including `some XUL dark matter <http://www.linuxtag.org/2007/en/conf/events/vp-samstag/details.html?talkid=109>`__.

I'll be hitting the `exhibition floor <http://www.linuxtag.org/2007/en/expo/expo-news.html>`__, too.
