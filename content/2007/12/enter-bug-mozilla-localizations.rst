Thanks to reed and `bug 353480 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=353480>`__, the Mozilla Localizations component on Bugzilla moved from "Client Support" over to the "Client Software" category, and is now available on the main `enter_bug.cgi <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi>`__ page. This should make it much easier for international testers to find their way to file bugs on our localizations, and is yet another small step showing off how much l10n within Mozilla has changed in the recent years. Yay. ` <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=353480>`__
