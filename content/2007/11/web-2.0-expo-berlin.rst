Does anybody know what a "Comp Pass" is? I got one, and I don't. Nor does anybody that's checking it. Anyway, it get's me onto the fairground and all, so...

If anybody of you has strong feelings on which presentation I should attend, and possibly even report on, please check out the `schedule <http://www.web2berlin.com/conference/conference-by-day.php>`__ and comment. I have some ideas, but as always, I'm torn, and the stuff that I'd attend is in parallel. So I'm happy to blame you if I don't end up in the bestest one.
