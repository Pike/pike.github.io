I listened to a talk by Matthias St√ºrmer on `crowding out effects in communities by monetary incentives <http://www.linuxtag.org/2007/en/conf/events/vp-freitag/details.html?talkid=198>`__. Gonna be interesting to have `Seth <http://blog.mozilla.org/seth>`__ and `Matthias <http://www.smi.ethz.ch/people/mstuerme>`__ look at the `Mozilla Community giving program <http://wiki.mozilla.org/Community:CommunityProgram>`__. The good news is, I feel that we're on the right track here from what I heard so far.
