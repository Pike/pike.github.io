I'm looking for code that generates statemachines in different languages from a single source. I peek at `SMC <http://smc.sourceforge.net/>`__, but I'm sure there's more. I'm looking for js, python, C/C++ output. Even more so, it should be kind-of simple to understand the syntax, and lightweight-ish to run.
