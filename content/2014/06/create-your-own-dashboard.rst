We have a lot of data around localizations, but it's hard to know what people might be looking for.

I just switched a new feature live, `edit your own dashboard <https://l10n.mozilla.org/shipping/>`__.

You can select branches of products, as well as the localizations you're interested in, and get data you want.

Say you're looking for `mobile and India <https://l10n.mozilla.org/shipping/dashboard?tree=fennec_aurora&tree=gaia&locale=as&locale=bn-IN&locale=gu&locale=gu-IN&locale=hi-IN&locale=kn&locale=mai&locale=ml&locale=mr&locale=or&locale=pa&locale=pa-IN&locale=ta&locale=te>`__. You'd want Firefox OS and Firefox for Android aka Fennec. The latter is actively localized on aurora, so you'd want the ``gaia`` tree and ``fennec_aurora``. You want Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati.... and 9 other languages. Select ``gu`` and ``pa``, too, 'cause why not.

Or are you keen on `Destop in Latin America <https://l10n.mozilla.org/shipping/dashboard?tree=fx_aurora&locale=es-AR&locale=es-CL&locale=es-MX&locale=pt-BR>`__? Again we're looking at Aurora, so ``fx_aurora`` is our tree of choice this time. Locales are Spanish in its American Variants, and Brazilian Portuguese.

Select generously, you can always reduce your selection through the controls on the right side of the resulting dashboard.

Play around, and compare the Status and History columns. Try to find stories, and share them in the comments below.

A bit more details on ``fx-aurora`` vs ``Firefox 32``. Right now, Firefox 32 is on the Aurora channel and repository branch. Thus, selecting either gives you the same data today. In six weeks, though, 32 is going to be on beta, so if you bookmark a link, it'd give you different data then. That's why you can only select one or the other.
