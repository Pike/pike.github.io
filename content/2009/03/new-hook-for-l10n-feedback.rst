We have a new hook for folks to get feedback on how to expose patches to localizers. We created a bugzilla account ``community@localization.bugs``, which interested localizers are going to follow. I for one do at least.

So when you have a bug and need input on how to localize it, you can now CC ``:l10n`` (part of that accounts real name) instead of just me, and get feedback from a variety of different localizers.

If you're a localizer that's willing to help out our developers on creating good patches for l10n, please start watching ``community@localization.bugs`` by `editing your mail preferences on bugzilla <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/userprefs.cgi?tab=email>`__.
