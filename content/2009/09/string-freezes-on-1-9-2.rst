As we're struggling with our string freezes for 1.9.2, I figured I'd put something up on planet for everyone to notice:

-  String freezes are one only, and done with. No "I'll get that in the next milestone". First string freeze is the last.
-  String freeze for mobile-browser and toolkit was last Friday. For mobile-browser seriously this Friday, Sept 11th. (*).
-  String freeze for Firefox 3.6 is Sept 14th.
