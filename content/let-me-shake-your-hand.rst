Timely for the 15 years of mozilla, let me share this with you.

I was wearing my Firefox hoodie in a store in San Francisco last week. I was trying to find out what to buy, and a young guy came by. I did let him pass, but he didn't find what he wanted, and left the store. Just a moment later he returned and said

   I've been using Firefox for 10 years, and I'd like to shake your hand.

First of all, feel your hand shaken. It's obviously us and not me.

But more importantly, this happened in the US. For the longest time, folks from the US would tell those stories coming back from Europe. We're finally there, across the globe.

And when it comes down to the mission, we're obviously winning. I love to tell people that I work for Mozilla. And mostly everybody knows that we exist, and more importantly, knows that they have a choice between various browsers. And they're making a choice.

So here's to 15 more years to choice and innovation on the internet.
