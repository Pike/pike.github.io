The short post I want to get out is "Thanks". I'll definitely try to get around and do the long post, but that requires me to have a dictionary by my side, it seems.

Thanks to the localizers, thanks to the developers, thanks to the drivers, thanks to the l10n team, thanks to the QA folks, thanks to build, thanks to IT, thanks to the web folks. And those are just the folks that pulled all-nighters just to get Firefox 2 out there in 37 languages, in one go, with support from web sites side.

Each of these deserve a paragraph or a post. I may end up doing short paragraphs, but given the "better is the evil of good" thing we have, let me just post the short version now.

Thanks.
