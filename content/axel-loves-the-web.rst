Good for the planet earth, I didn't print poster number 5. I've put it up on `people.mozilla.org <http://people.mozilla.org/~axel/onewebday/>`__, hopefully that's serving it with a mime type that's full of love.

Bad for planet mozilla, I did take `a picture <http://www.flickr.com/photos/axelhecht/3945318708/>`__ and here I'm blogging about it.

Yes, I love the web so much, you can hardly see me. But you do see real full screen on a mac, German namoroka nightly. And you the same one web on my N810 (not so current 1.9.2 nightly). And the infamous "Don't hurt the web" shirt with that, of course.
