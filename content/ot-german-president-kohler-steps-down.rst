Sorry for the off-topic post.

President Köhler stepped down. Not a bad move, in my opinion. He came out of Afghanistan and promised our soldiers out there to get support for them back home. And he got back with political cat fight. After the discussion here in Germany of the past few days, he would have never been able to step up for our soldiers around the globe without 2nd or 3rd rank politicians attacking him as being anti-constitutional, and so the soldiers doing service. Independent of the politics, this is not what our soldiers out there deserve, so stepping down from duty is a fair move. And once you get there, you gotta do that ASAP. There's no room for a president that can't position himself (or herself, going forward?) when soldiers die doing service.

Sadly that's reducing the President of the Federal Republic of Germany to a single point, which isn't fair. But this is a point the president can't fail, and thus I think that Köhler stepping down could very well be the lesser one of two evils.

Off-topic post, as in, this is my personal opinion and in no way affiliated with my roles within Mozilla.
