Is anyone working on an object-relational-mapping for js and mozstorage? Say, something like `sqlachemy does <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/04/ormtutorial.html>`__? Using JS1.7 iterators and generators, that should be totally feasible. That is, for someone that knows SQL, which is not me.

Thus RFE, any volunteers or takers out there?
