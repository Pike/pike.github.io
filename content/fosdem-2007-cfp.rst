If you have an idea what you would like to do in or around the Mozilla Developers Room at FOSDEM 2007, please add that to the `wiki <http://wiki.mozilla.org/Fosdem:2007>`__. In particular, if you want to present something, that'd be good to know early, so that folks tempted to attend know what they miss out on if they don't.

PS: No **P**\ apers required, just **P**\ articipation.
