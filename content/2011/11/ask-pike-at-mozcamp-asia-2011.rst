I'll be at MozCamp Asia 2011, and as I haven't been to Asia outside of India, I figured I should talk about the things you want me to talk about, and not about what's on my head.

Thus, the session is gonna be titled "Ask Pike", and I'm `fielding questions on google moderator <http://www.google.com/moderator/#16/e=14fa62>`__. Of course, I'll also take questions live.

See you in KL.
