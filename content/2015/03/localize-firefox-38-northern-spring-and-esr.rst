| Firefox 38 is now string frozen. On March 30th, we'll migrate 38 to
| beta, which gives you a week and a half to get the translation work into
| a great state.

| This is one of our two big releases this year, and it's the ESR, so it's
| going to be around for a while.

We ended up with a good 300 strings for 38; they're split across:

-  Reader View and Reading List
-  Hello (tab sharing for example)
-  Developer Tools

Upcoming schedule for 38 and the northern-spring release:

-  March 30: Migrate from aurora to beta
-  April 6: Marketing material string freeze (including content for
   mozilla.org)
-  April 30: last chance to get changes in on beta
-  May 12: Release Firefox 38, and celebrate

| We've been talking to Dwayne about opening up 38 on Beta on locamotion,
| and giving you all the goodness there. He'll follow up on that.

Thank you so much for your contributions and your patience.
